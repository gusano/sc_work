for use with Ndef or ProxySpace.
so far (need rewrite and cleanup):
- Behringer BCR 2000
- Doepfer Pocket Dial (endless mode)

NOTE:
those are inspired by MIDIKTL (BCR was first written with adc/jrh help in a workshop,
PocketDialKtl is quickly stolen from PDKtl but I plan to make it different anyway.

both have a different usage than JITMIDIKTL.

help files coming soon (maybe)
